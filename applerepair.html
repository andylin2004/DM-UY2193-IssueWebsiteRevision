                <p>Your first instinct is to go to an Apple Store to get it fixed.</p>
                <p>However, once you go to the Apple Store, you find out it's going to cost you an arm and a leg.</p>

                <img class="cropdownimg" src="img/selfrepair.jpg">
                <p>Then you try to fix it yourself, since you don't to pay an insane amount of money to Apple.</p>
                <p>But you realize that Apple is a weirdo and uses strange screws that you don't have a screwdriver for.</p>
                <p>You give up because you think its going to be way too hard to fix.</p>

                <p>So you go to your local repair shop, hoping that they can fix the device.</p>
                <p>They successfully repaired your device, or so you thought...</p>

                <p>But turns out something ended up breaking....</p>
                <p>but its actually a malicious attempt at making you go back to Apple to get your things repaired.</p>
                <p>These functions being disabled are actually a way for you to question if you repaired your own things correctly or question if you should trust your local repair shop to properly fix things.</p>
