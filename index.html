        <p>If you want to do it cheaply, you'd want to try and fix it yourself!</p>
        <p>But most companies don't want you to do that.</p>
        <p>(or if they do let you do that, they'll make it seem like your device is super messed up)</p>

        <h3>What is right to repair?</h3>
        <h4>Simply put, it is the right to freely repair things without companies refusing to repair something or degrading functionality and to be able to use parts from anywhere to fix a device up without causing issues!</h4>
        <p>If you care about being able to do whatever you want to do to your own device without any repercussion, then this is very important.</p>
